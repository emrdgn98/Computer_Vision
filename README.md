This repository includes studies about my graduation project's topic. It is about the Lane Tracing Systems. 

I used images and various videos and I get some lane shapes on this images. Then the algorithm detects the lane and marks them.

The process contains different algorithms like Canny Edge Detection , Hough Transform , Sobel Filter and Windows sliding search etc.

And the process is that

1-)Import opencv and the other libraries

2-)Ä°mread the image or frame(for video) and make gray

3-)Apply blur and canny function

4-)Hough transform to estimate the points 

5-)Seperate the points left and right

6-)Show the points as a line on the original image  

If you want to know more , you can read my graduation project's thesis. You can find that in the documents.
